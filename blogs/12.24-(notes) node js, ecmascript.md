# Node JS and Express JS Overview (13.12.24)

Date: December 13, 2024

## Node JS

Node JS (NJS) is a free JavaScript runtime environment designed for building scalable and high-performance applications.  
It is ideal for creating:

- Servers
- Web applications
- Command-line tools (CLI)
- Scripts

### Key Features:

- **Built-in Tools**:  
  Node JS offers several in-built modules for tasks such as:
  - Creating HTTP servers
  - Writing tests with assertions
  - Reading and hashing files
  - Creating stream pipelines
  - Working with threads

---

## Express JS

Express JS (EJS) is a fast, minimalist, and unopinionated web framework for Node JS.  
It is commonly used for creating web applications and APIs, particularly **RESTful APIs** that handle client CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) requests.

### Key Features:

- **Web App Creation**:  
  EJS simplifies the process of creating web applications and APIs.
- **RESTful APIs**:  
  EJS is often used to build RESTful APIs that interact with client requests.
- **Integration with Middleware**:  
  EJS often works with packages like **Morgan** to log incoming requests.

### Example Code:

```javascript
// Your file that exports app
import express from "express";
const app = express();

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use("/api/resource", router);

// Export default app
export default app;

// A file with CRUD and reset helper functions
export async function addItem() {
  // Add item logic
}

export async function deleteItem() {
  // Delete item logic
}

export async function getItems() {
  // Get items logic
}

export async function reset(dataToInsert) {
  await pool.query("SQL Code to drop table");
  await pool.query("SQL Code to insert data into table");
  return insertedData;
}

// A file with PostgreSQL pool setup
import pg from "pg";
export const pool = new pg.Pool({ connectionString: process.env.URL });
```
