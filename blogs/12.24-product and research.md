# Product, market research and user research (5.12.24)

Product experts and research are often overlooked parts of the software industry.

As we've all heard before, "can something be done?" is not the same as "should something be done?"

In supporting early-stage startups looking for big VC funding, I've seen incredible highly technical things built.

Software engineers, back-end engineers, machine learning engineers - creating things that few would have thought possible just a few decades ago.

These things rightly impress investors.

But impressing an investor is different to impressing consumers.

It is different to _engaging_ consumers.

**What have we achieved if we build something that no one wants to try?**

To be successful as a business one must deeply know their market, how the market is changing, their competitors, their would-be competitors that ended up in the graveyard, their users' needs, and how those problems are and could be solved.

It is not enough just to build.
