# Rethinking React (6.12.24)

Having worked with React and Next.js over the past year and a half, I wanted to share my perspective on React and explain its core principles.

"Thinking in React" is an article that most React developers are likely familiar with. It introduces React for traditional web developers and talks about its main features.

In this blog, I’ll attempt to break down React in a way that reflects how I would describe it in my own words.

## From Traditional Web Development to React

Before diving into React, I was accustomed to working with just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to build websites. In traditional web development, HTML structures the content, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity.

**So, why would anyone choose React over traditional web technologies? What sets React apart, and what advantages does it offer?**

React is often praised for simplifying the process of building user interfaces (UIs), and for good reason. The main difference between React and traditional web development lies in how you manage the UI updates.

In traditional web development, you typically write functions to manipulate and update the DOM (Document Object Model). For example, you may need to manually update text content or re-render elements when their state changes. With React, however, you define state-based variables that automatically trigger re-renders when they change. This eliminates the need for manual DOM manipulation.

For instance, imagine a counter application with a button to increment the count. With React, you can use a state variable for the counter, and when the state changes, React will automatically update the DOM without needing to manually write functions to change the text content. The value will update smoothly on the client side, from 0 to 1 to 2, and so on.

React allows you to manage various types of state, such as text content, file paths, form inputs, conditional formatting, and much more. Developers can do this all in a _declarative manner_, rather than the traditional imperative manner where each step of how to update the DOM needs to be spelled out explicitly. React handles the complexity of updating the DOM as the state changes (which may be multifaceted), making code easier to manage. React ensures that the entire UI stays in sync with the latest state automatically.

## Components: The Building Blocks of React

Another key concept in React is component-based architecture. Instead of duplicating code across different pages or parts of your website, you can create reusable components that encapsulate both the logic and UI. Components are self-contained units that represent a part of your interface, and they can be imported and reused throughout your app.

In React, components can also be nested, meaning a component can contain other components. This hierarchical structure makes your code more modular and maintainable.

For example, you could have a ProfileCard component that contains several sub-components like Heading, ProfileImage, and Bio. This composability makes it easier to maintain and scale your app, as you don’t have to rewrite the same logic over and over again.

## The Virtual DOM: Optimizing Performance

One of React's most powerful features is the Virtual DOM. The Virtual DOM is an abstraction of the actual DOM, which React uses to optimize rendering. When the state of a component changes, React first updates the Virtual DOM, and then it compares it to the actual DOM to determine the most efficient way to apply the changes. This process, which I recently found out is called "reconciliation," ensures that only the parts of the page that have changed are re-rendered, rather than the entire page.

This approach dramatically reduces the number of updates to the DOM, leading to better performance and a smoother user experience, particularly in large, complex applications.

## React in the Context of a Full Stack

Although React is powerful on its own, it's often used in conjunction with frameworks like Next.js (or Nest.js in some cases) to extend its capabilities. Next.js, for example, builds on top of React and adds features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and routing for multi-page applications. These features allow React to be used in both client-side and server-side rendering contexts, improving the performance of your application and making it easier to manage SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for content-heavy websites.

## Challenges of React

Despite its strengths, React has some drawbacks, especially as applications grow in complexity. One challenge is managing large-scale applications, particularly when it comes to organizing and separating server-side and client-side code. React itself is client-side by default, but it is often combined with server-side frameworks like Next.js to provide a complete solution.

For very large applications, React’s architecture can become hard to manage without good practices, such as neatly-organised component-based design patterns and the effective use of Context ('globally available state'). I understand that state management libraries like Redux can also be beneficial..

Finally, while React is an excellent tool for building dynamic and interactive UIs, it might not be the best choice for applications with extremely complex server-side logic. Here, other frameworks like Angular can be more useful - though many developers find it has a steeper learning curve.

## Conclusion

React is an incredibly powerful tool for building dynamic and performant user interfaces. Its declarative nature, component-based architecture, and Virtual DOM make it easier to build scalable, maintainable applications. Like any framwork though, it isn't without its drawbacks.
